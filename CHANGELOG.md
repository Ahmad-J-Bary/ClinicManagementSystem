## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added

#### Architecture Enhancements
- **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Complete separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Persistence, and API layers
- **CQRS Pattern**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation using MediatR for clear separation between read and write operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Generic and specific repositories for clean data access abstraction
- **Specification Pattern**: Complex query logic encapsulation for maintainable data access

#### Application Layer
- **MediatR Integration**: Complete CQRS implementation with commands, queries, and handlers
- **AutoMapper Profiles**: Centralized object-to-object mapping configurations
- **FluentValidation**: Comprehensive input validation with business rules
- **Custom Exceptions**: Domain-specific exception handling (BadRequestException, NotFoundException)
- **Validation Pipeline**: Automatic validation in MediatR pipeline using ValidationBehavior

#### Infrastructure Layer
- **Email Service Interface**: Comprehensive email service for appointment notifications and patient communications
- **Logging Service**: Structured logging with Serilog integration
- **Service Registration**: Clean dependency injection setup following best practices

#### Persistence Layer
- **Entity Framework Core**: Complete database context with proper entity configurations
- **Generic Repository**: Base repository implementation with common CRUD operations
- **Patient Repository**: Domain-specific repository with advanced query methods
- **Specification Evaluator**: Dynamic query building using the specification pattern
- **Database Context**: Automatic audit fields and entity state management

#### API Layer
- **Enhanced Controllers**: CQRS-based controllers using MediatR for clean separation

- **Swagger Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **Health Checks**: Database and application health monitoring
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin request support for frontend integration

#### Domain Enhancements
- **Complete Entity Model**: All clinic entities with proper relationships and business logic
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific validation and business logic in entities
- **Enums**: Comprehensive enumeration types for status tracking and categorization

#### Development Workflow
- **Conventional Commits**: Structured commit message format for better tracking
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branch strategy with proper branching conventions
- **Code Organization**: Clean folder structure following architectural principles

### Technical Improvements

#### Performance
- **Async/Await**: Comprehensive asynchronous programming throughout the application
- **Entity Framework Optimizations**: Proper query optimization and change tracking
- **Specification Pattern**: Efficient query composition and reusability

#### Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all entry points
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through Entity Framework Core
- **Exception Handling**: Secure error responses without sensitive information exposure

#### Maintainability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear architectural boundaries and responsibilities
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper IoC container usage throughout the application
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with environment-specific settings

#### Testing Support
- **Testable Architecture**: Clean architecture enables comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Repository Abstraction**: Mockable data access layer for unit testing
- **CQRS Handlers**: Isolated business logic for focused testing

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive README**: Detailed setup, architecture, and usage documentation
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration with detailed endpoint descriptions
- **Code Comments**: Extensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- **Architecture Documentation**: Clear explanation of design decisions and patterns

### Configuration
- **Environment Support**: Development, staging, and production configuration support
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring for dependencies
- **Logging Configuration**: Structured logging with multiple output targets
- **Database Configuration**: Flexible connection string management

### Dependencies
- **.NET 8**: Latest .NET framework with performance improvements
- **Entity Framework Core 8**: Modern ORM with advanced features
- **MediatR 12**: Latest CQRS implementation
- **AutoMapper 12**: Object-to-object mapping
- **FluentValidation 11**: Fluent validation library
- **Serilog**: Structured logging framework
- **Swashbuckle**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Breaking Changes
- **Complete Architecture Overhaul**: Migration from simple layered architecture to Clean Architecture
- **CQRS Implementation**: Controllers now use MediatR instead of direct service calls
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access now goes through repository abstractions
- **Validation Changes**: FluentValidation replaces data annotations for complex validation

### Migration Notes
- **Database Schema**: New Entity Framework migrations required for enhanced entity model
- **API Contracts**: Some endpoint signatures may have changed due to DTO restructuring
- **Configuration**: New configuration sections required for email and logging services

### Known Issues
- **Authentication**: JWT authentication implementation is prepared but not yet active
- **Testing**: Unit and integration test projects need to be created
- **Migrations**: Database migrations need to be generated and applied

### Future Enhancements
- **JWT Authentication**: Complete authentication and authorization implementation
- **Real-time Notifications**: SignalR integration for live updates
- **Advanced Reporting**: Business intelligence and analytics features
- **Mobile API**: Dedicated mobile application endpoints
- **Docker Support**: Containerization for easy deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-10 (Original Version)

### Added
- Basic clinic management system structure
- Simple CRUD operations for patients, doctors, and appointments
- Basic Entity Framework Core setup
- Simple API controllers
- Basic domain entities

### Architecture
- Simple layered architecture
- Basic repository pattern
- Direct service calls in controllers
- Basic entity relationships

This version served as the foundation for the enhanced implementation, providing the core domain model and basic functionality that was then significantly improved and restructured in version 1.0.0.
